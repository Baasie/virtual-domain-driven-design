      "One of the more confusing concepts in Domain-Driven Desing is that of problem and solution space. There has been a long debate on Twitter and the ddd-crew github:
      https://github.com/ddd-crew/strategic-architecture-building-blocks/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

      People wonder how distilling the Core with the Core, supportive and generic subdomains fit and what space. What concepts are in the problem space, and what is the solution? And what is a precise definition of problem and solution space?

      Join us in this session are a diverse group of people spanning multiple disciplines to look at how they see the relationship(s) between problem and solution space in IT. And hopefully, in the end, we can have a useful, consistent model of those relationships between problem and solution space, core, supportive, generics (sub)domains for the #DDDesign community.

      With us will be:
      Dawn N Ahukanna
      Jabe Bloom
      Indi Young
      Nick Tune
