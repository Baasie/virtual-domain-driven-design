      "There are many reasons to split up large-scale systems towards more modular, smaller services with their own model and language. You can decouple teams and give full autonomy of that service to a team. By decoupling services and teams you can handle changes to the domain faster, having a faster time to market. You decrease the cognitive load of the teams, empowering teams to truly understand the complexity of their shared models with domain experts.

      But how do we split up large-scale systems? What are the characteristics we can dissect a bounded context? How do we split towards a microservices architecture? We do not only have to deal with shifting terminology here but also different rates of change in the business.

      Join us in this Panel where we will hunt for design heuristics to split systems towards bounded contexts and microservices.

      With us will be:
      Rebecca Wirfs-brock
      Chris Richardson
      Alberto Brandolini
      Nick Tune
      Krisztina Hirth
      Trond Hjorteland
