      "Thanks to Krisztina we will have Matteo Collina as a special guest
      on our next panel. Matteo is a long time Nodejs contributor and TSC member. Open-source
      software is a success story, and undoubtedly one, we can learn from. In OSS the
      clocks tick differently, but it is software built for users, to solve problems
      - both relatively unknowns factors at the beginning. So what can DDD developers
      for businesses learn from that experience: how to handle these uncertainties,  how
      is the Ubiquitous Language developed in the Open source world? How do you do design
      in OSS? And many more questions!"

  - title: "[Hands-on] Exploring Techniques For Modelling Bounded Context Collaboration"

      "As Vladik Khononov says, minimising complexity in software systems is about balancing local vs global complexity. A major source of global complexity is the interaction between components in an architecture.
      In DDD, architectural components are bounded contexts and they interact using commands, queries, and events. While this is clear, the tools for modelling and visualising bounded context interaction are not so clear.
      In this hands-on meetup, we're going to explore different techniques that are used to design and visualise bounded context integration including:
      - UML Sequence Diagrams
      - Domain Storytelling
      - EventStorming
      - Domain Message Flow Modelling
      We will look at the pros & cons of each technique, and we will discuss ways to improve each technique. You will also have the chance to share other techniques you think are useful.
      The second part of this workshop will involve splitting into small groups and modelling a scenario using one or more of the discussed techniques."
