      Using collaborative modelling to build a shared understanding of your domain and use it to guide your design _is_ the philosophy behind DDD though. The rest is the principles, patterns, and practices. But perhaps just doing EventStorming does not actually make you a DDD'er, but what is?
      In today's panel, we will discuss with several people from the community what makes you a DDD'er? Joining us are:
      Emanuela Damiani
      Krisztina Hirth
      Mathias Verraes
      Jessica White
      Nick Tune"
