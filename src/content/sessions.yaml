      "In the last meetup, Krisztina found something Jessica said interesting to dive into:
      'We are talking in DDD about Bounded Contexts and independent teams and applications,
      but then we all coupled by having the same user.' That statement led to an exciting
      dialogue by inviting Dawn: 'It is not so much coupling at the user as that sounds as
      if the user has to fit into what has built but starting with the user in the centre or
      intersection of the various 'contexts'. If your context no longer aligns with the user,
      who are you problem-solving/building the solution for?'
      Joining us with Krisztina, Jessica and Dawn will be Manuel from the Book team topologies,
      and together we will explore heuristics to organise teams, and their interaction and design
      bounded context for fast flow, which each serve the same customer."

      "If you could influence one impactful decision today, what would it be? If you could be heard
      and trusted for 10 minutes, what would you say? To whom? More importantly,
      how do you transform recommendations into well-reasoned decisions arrived at collectively?
      In this workshop, we’ll strengthen our ability to craft a strategic argument that gets heard.
      We’ll work together to strengthen a position and the reasons that support it.
      We’ll explore the fundamental skills required and brainstorm follow-up activities."
