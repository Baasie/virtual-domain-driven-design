      " Wardley Mapping is a great tool in the DDD practitioner toolkit. Use it to explore and define domains and bounded contexts, examine the implications of change, compare different strategic options, and design the team topologies needed to make them happen. But what are the most effective ways to use this highly effective tool in collaboration with others?\nThere are several challenges with Wardley Mapping for collaboration and communication. What if people can't read or write maps? How far should you go to get an agreement on a map? And what about mapping that contradicts politics or authority? Join us for this hands-on session with Ben Mosior and Kenny Baas-Schwegler, where we will tour different ways of Wardley Mapping together and discuss their tradeoffs.",

      "[Hands-on] Exploring Techniques For Modelling Bounded Context Collaboration",
    date: "Thursday, August 13th. 2020",
    time: "19:00 CEST",
    description:
      "As Vladik Khononov says, minimising complexity in software systems is about balancing local vs global complexity. A major source of global complexity is the interaction between components in an architecture. In DDD, architectural components are bounded contexts and they interact using commands, queries, and events. While this is clear, the tools for modelling and visualising bounded context interaction are not so clear. In this hands-on meetup, we're going to explore different techniques that are used to design and visualise bounded context integration including: - UML Sequence Diagrams - Domain Storytelling - EventStorming - Domain Message Flow Modelling We will look at the pros & cons of each technique, and we will discuss ways to improve each technique. You will also have the chance to share other techniques you think are useful. The second part of this workshop will involve splitting into small groups and modelling a scenario using one or more of the discussed techniques.",
