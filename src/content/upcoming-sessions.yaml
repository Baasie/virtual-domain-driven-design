      "In this hands-on session we will us a small legacy example that contains all the
      monstrosities that we find in legacy today. We will use DDD to analyze and refactor
      problems such as: large entities that are used all over the system and how we could
      divide them into smaller entities that live in different bounded contexts, the lack of value
      objects and what kind of value object could be introduced, and an anemic domain model
      and how we can improve it towards a rich domain model. In this session you will tackle a
      messy piece of Java code. Please be there with a running IDE for Java and download
      Step 1 of the example beforehand from https://github.com/lilienth/ddd-banking-example."
