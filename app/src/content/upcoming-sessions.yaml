#      "Do Software architects have a bad name? Why? What are your expectations, what anti-patterns you experience? What are you thankful for from your architects? Should you have a software architect in the team, or between the teams?
#
#       Changing the world starts with thinking and sharing the reasons. We would like to discuss this conflict at our next meetup in this open discussion.
#       Please reach out if you are a developer and you would like to participate in a constructive discussion.
#       Until then: fire away, put your thoughts, stories, examples on this https://t.co/dMUUI4DH1S?amp=1 miro board Thank you!"
