      Using collaborative modelling to build a shared understanding of your domain and use it to guide your design _is_ the philosophy behind DDD though. The rest is the principles, patterns, and practices. But perhaps just doing EventStorming does not actually make you a DDD'er, but what is?
      In today's panel, we will discuss with several people from the community what makes you a DDD'er? Joining us are:

You also have different flavours like Detroit being inside-out, or London going from the outside-in. And then you have people saying TDD is about testing or is it a design tool? In this session, we will talk with Dave Farley about all these topics, and especially how to use TDD as a design tool. Dave Farley is well known in the software community, especially being the co-author of the continuous delivery book. He is also a firm believer that Test-driven development is one of the core principles to do proper continuous delivery."

      Of course, we could spend two hours talking and discussing the theory around Context Maps and the related patterns but this time around we will apply them together in practice. This VDDD meetup episode will be based on a case study with some bounded contexts already being present. From there on we will explore the usage of the patterns found in the context map and we will also weigh in on some heuristics regarding their usage.

      This session will contain 0% slides, it will be all hands-on context mapping."

    description: "
      The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced us DDD practitioners to move our collaborative modelling efforts to the remote world. Within collaborative modelling, we want to share all the information we have, all the different perceptions, even if they might look weird, quirky or invalid at the start. Only then can we design and create enriched models to build sustainable and valuable software. The problem here is, people will only share all their information if there is psychological safety, and that is already hard in a physical session, let alone remote.

      In this session, we will have a dialogue with Gitte Klitgaard about the importance of psychological safety in these sessions. Why is it important and what are her heuristics and patterns for it in a remote session.

      Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach with more than a decade of experience working for companies as well as coaching individuals. She lives and loves agile, and hates turf wars, which is why she took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods, when we can use that energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people work better together and feel better about themselves. She is known for speaking her mind in a way that helps people actually listen to what she says; maybe because her main working tools are listening and caring. As an active part of the agile community, Gitte often engages in discussions online and offline, and is part of the organiser team of German Agile Coach Camp as well as a facilitator at other events.

      "Too many products have been developed that serve one kind of client only.
      The reason is that the composition of the teams leads (subconsciously) to the development of products that serve only people that resemble the people in the team.
      One “famous” example is the soap dispenser that only works if your skin is white.

      If teams are really cross-functional and are resembling the diversity of the market, the products they’re creating are also better.
      Thus, if the whole team has the full business expertise, knows the market, reflects the full diversity of the clients,
      then it can even disrupt the market and isn’t waiting for some person (e.g. the Product Owner) to decide on priorities.
      With this real cross-functionality, the team can fully understand the company’s business and has a holistic view of it, knowing its contribution to the company’s value stream.

      Join us in a Panel dialogue with Jutta Eckstein and Maryse Meinen about that
      real cross-functional teams are an essential building block for implementing company-wide agility and
      the organization benefits by creating better and in a way more real products and by having more options when entering the war of talent."

      "As Vladik Khononov says, minimising complexity in software systems is about balancing local vs global complexity. A major source of global complexity is the interaction between components in an architecture.
      In DDD, architectural components are bounded contexts and they interact using commands, queries, and events. While this is clear, the tools for modelling and visualising bounded context interaction are not so clear.
      In this hands-on meetup, we're going to explore different techniques that are used to design and visualise bounded context integration including:
      - UML Sequence Diagrams
      - Domain Storytelling
      - EventStorming
      - Domain Message Flow Modelling
      We will look at the pros & cons of each technique, and we will discuss ways to improve each technique. You will also have the chance to share other techniques you think are useful.
      The second part of this workshop will involve splitting into small groups and modelling a scenario using one or more of the discussed techniques."

      clocks tick differently, but it is software built for users, to solve problems
      - both relatively unknowns factors at the beginning. So what can DDD developers
      for businesses learn from that experience: how to handle these uncertainties,  how
      is the Ubiquitous Language developed in the Open source world? How do you do design

      'We are talking in DDD about Bounded Contexts and independent teams and applications,
      but then we all coupled by having the same user.' That statement led to an exciting
      dialogue by inviting Dawn: 'It is not so much coupling at the user as that sounds as
      if the user has to fit into what has built but starting with the user in the centre or
      intersection of the various 'contexts'. If your context no longer aligns with the user,
      who are you problem-solving/building the solution for?'
      Joining us with Krisztina, Jessica and Dawn will be Manuel from the Book team topologies,
      and together we will explore heuristics to organise teams, and their interaction and design
      bounded context for fast flow, which each serve the same customer."

The problem is, how do we balance these two polarities from an either-or to both-and thinking.

      "As complexity increases, are you (too often) shouting into the wind? Do you see icebergs ahead yet fail to convince others to avoid them? Are your architecture-focused discussions more exhausting than productive?
      Does the accountant understand the value of your work? The thinking and communication skills we've developed on the job often fail us when we face more-complex challenges.
      That is why we are learning DDD. Rather than double down on code-specific solutions, we are developing different, more effective conceptual approaches.
      Yet, there is an underlying skillset the nourishes and supports our ability to practice DDD or any approach that challenges traditional 'power' structures. In this workshop, we'll focus on that skillset.
      We'll explore the four fundamental truths:

      - Conway was right: communication architects software and systems

      - Uncertainty is always a factor

      - Fred Brooks was right: conceptual integrity matters most

      - Continuous learning is essential: the modern hero is the person who weaves everyone else's expertise into a cohesive, trustworthy whole

      And we'll explore four fundamental practices:

      - Argumentation: creating strong and valid solutions based on sound reasoning

      - Structuring collective reasoning: thinking well together

      - Recognizing conceptual fallacies

      - Cultivating the right types of energy: aka thoughts are only part of communication

      “95% of the words are spent extolling the benefits of ‘modularity’ and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it” - Glenford J. Myers, 1978.

      This quote is 40 years old. Today, 4 decades later, nothing has changed except terminology. Time to change this. I want to talk about the various strategies of decomposing systems into modular components.

      You will learn what exactly Bounded Contexts and Microservices are, and what are the differences between the two notions. We will analyze what happens between services - how data flows, and how these flows can be optimized.

      Ultimately, we will explore different decomposition strategies and heuristics for designing modular systems - systems that aren’t driven by ever-changing fads, but by your business needs."

      In this meetup, we are going to brainstorm and catalogue a collection of techniques and strategies DDD newcomers can use to help people in their organisations see the benefits of Domain-Driven Design.

      If you are new to DDD and would like help, or if you are experienced and would like to offer your advice, please attend this highly-collaborative session and share your ideas. We'll be working on Miro, the online whiteboard, for collaborating.

      Following this session, the ideas we collect will be shared as an open source github repository so they are freely available to anyone new to DDD. The repository will also allow anyone to make a pull request at any time if they have a problem or advice."

      "When designing organizations for fast flow of change, we need to find effective boundaries between different streams of change. Techniques like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) are very powerful for this but can be quite involved and difficult to learn. A lightweight intermediate approach is to ask 'could this thing be run as a cloud-hosted (SaaS) service or product?'.

      This session explores the Independent Service Heuristics, a kind of “DDD-Lite” approach based on ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. The Independent Service Heuristics help teams to find candidate services and domains for running as a separate value stream or separate service.

      The Independent Service Heuristics have proven useful for various organizations improving flow. In this session, we would really welcome feedback and critique of the approach. Where might the approach not work? What pitfalls might there be? Are there questions or material missing?

      Wardley Mapping is a strategic tool for anticipating how domains will evolve over time.

      In this session, we’ll learn the basic theory behind Wardley Maps and then jump into hands-on exercises.

      It is recommended that you read Ben Mosior’s excellent article before attending this session: Wardley Mapping with Miro.

      "Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a term that was coined by Dan North in 2006. It came about as a response to a very specific problem – teaching developers how to think about testing their code.
      It incorporates the ubiquitous language idea from Eric Evan’s book Domain-Driven Design, and this evolved into a technique used by the whole team to collaboratively specify how the finished system should behave.
      While both approaches focus on collaboration, DDD focuses on a shared model for building software and BDD focusses on specifying the behaviour of the system. So what can we learn from both our techniques?
      Join us in this session were Seb Rose, Steve Tooke and Matt Wynne will discuss with us how we can improve modelling with BDD. We will bust popular BDD myths and talk about their favourite collaboration techniques."

      "The power of collaborative modelling comes from having a diverse group of people who, together, have a lot of wisdom and knowledge.
      You would expect that all this knowledge will be put to use, co-creating, and to design a model. In reality, we don’t actually listen to all the available input and perspectives due to cognitive biases and ranking.
      Good modelling needs all the insights and perception to design the best one. If you are not aware, cognitive biases and ranking kills those insights and kills the effectiveness of your models!
      Join us in this session talking with Evelyn van Kelle and Romeu Moura about how awareness of your own cognitive biases and your ranking in the group can create more effective models!
      We will discuss how to use biases and ranking in your favour, making sure people are not excluded, and every knowledge is rally heard and put to good use in your models!"

      Join us in a conversation with Julie Lerman, Indu Alagarsamy, Michael Plod and Nick Tune to talk about these nuances. We will talk about all the concept of dealing with these translations.

      Join us with Thierry de Pauw in this Virtual DDD sessions to explore with us how feature branching can impact domain-driven design.
      Because one of the critical aspects of DDD is to keep gaining new insights together to create a rich and rigid domain model. For this, we need fast feedback which could be disabled by feature branching."

      Why? It can't just be because the Bluebook is so thick? We're going to argue that the near enemies of DDD are to blame. Things which look like DDD, but which are in fact counterfeits that push us farther away from our goal.
      Join us with Gayathri and Andrew who will tell the story of a large-scale DDD implementation that got complicated. They'll talk about how took stock of the situation as they found it, how they identified where the root problems lay, how they set everyone off on a course of success, and the mistakes we made along the way.
      Regardless of whether you are working with serverless, microservices or a more monolithic architecture (nothing wrong there!) - this fun talk is for those who want to learn the lessons of implementing DDD at scale, with a healthy dose of pitfalls and hazards to watch out for too."

      "In this SPA conference special, we will talk with Trond Hjorteland about if business capabilities are useful in DDD.
      The DDD community seems to consist of mostly technical people, or at least with sort of hands-on programming experience, both now an back when the blue book was published. The decision to put the technical patterns at the start of that book was strategic (!) in that it was meant to invite the programmers in. As a consequence of that, it seems that most know very little about the enterprises' architecture space, and if they do, it seems to be with disdain for those dreaded ivory architects. And, for good reason in a lot of large waterfall-driven enterprises.

      My thesis is that by this approach we as a community is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, at least parts. There are things we ought to take a look at and incorporate into our toolbox, like architectural principles and business capabilities. The latter has been something I have had a special keen interest for, coming from the SOA space, and see a lot of parallels with the strategic patterns in DDD. I even believe it can be a great technique for getting started with discovering the problem space and even guide defining the bounded contexts.

      I would love to have a good discussion on this and maybe we all can gain new insights. That is always good, right?"

      "In this next virtual DDD meetup, João Rosa and Krisztina Hirth will discuss with us how impact mapping helps to find the possible solutions to achieve a measurable goal before you even know what to visualize.
      Also, how can you then combine it with other visualisation tools like EventStorming to guide your strategic design?

      In our industry, we have been assisting in digital transformations; the digital transformations have different labels, DevOps, Agile, Cloud, amongst others.
      However, most of these transformations just following a script, applying the same recipe everywhere. This approach has its merits, but also its pitfalls.

      To balance the change, visualisation techniques can be applied, aiding people, teams and organisations to manage the change and guide strategic design."

      "On this first SunDDDay 26th May at 16:30 Central European Time (Amsterdam GMT +2), virtual DDD meetup will hold an online panel discussion where you can ask questions!

      Marco Heimeshoff, and Kenny baas-Schwegler (with a possible attendance by Zsófia Herendi and Trond Hjorteland) will discuss their experience with EventStorming and User story mapping for domain discovery.

      The two main questions are:
      * How can we best combine User Story Mapping and EventStorming for domain discovery.
      * How can we go from EventStorming to user stories."

      I am also pleased to announce another great presenter Helin Akgul. She will be talking about DDD practices in TransferWise, and she will be giving examples around how they are using product engineering to create domain experts, and tips and tricks to adopting DDD practices gradually.
      I will post the abstract of her talk very soon."

      "Have you thought about that maybe all you know about patterns is just misconceptions?
      In this talk, Kevlin will take us to an alternative tour of patterns, one that is based on improving the habitability of code, communication, exploration, empiricism, reasoning, incremental development, sharing design and bridging rather than barricading different levels of expertise.
      Apparently, everyone knows about patterns. Except for those who don't. Which is basically all the people who've never come across patterns... plus many of the people who have.
      Singleton is often treated as a must-know pattern. Patterns are sometimes considered to be the basis of blueprint-driven architecture. Patterns are sometimes seen as a fixed set of ideas to apply within a school of thinking and practice, such as DDD. Patterns are also seen as something you don't need to know any more because you've got frameworks, libraries and middleware by the download. Or that patterns are something you don't need to know because you're building on diagrams, legacy code or emergent design. All these and more are misconceptions about patterns.
      Let's shift the focus from consuming patterns to recognising them, mining them and reasoning through them, with them and about them."
