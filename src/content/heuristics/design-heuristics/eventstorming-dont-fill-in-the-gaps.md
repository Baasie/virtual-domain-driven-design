# Description

If we want to generate new insight during an eventstorming, we must delay to structure the EventStorm. Do this by leaving gaps between the patterns so that people can use there own perception to fill these in.

# Summary of the solution

When you give clear, concrete structured answers, in this case when you start using the colour coding in a strict way, people won't get new insights. People will only get new insights and an epiphany when they fill in gaps themselve and patterns from the chaos start to emerge for them.
