      "In the last meetup, Krisztina found something Jessica said interesting to dive into:
      'We are talking in DDD about Bounded Contexts and independent teams and applications,
      but then we all coupled by having the same user.' That statement led to an exciting
      dialogue by inviting Dawn: 'It is not so much coupling at the user as that sounds as
      if the user has to fit into what has built but starting with the user in the centre or
      intersection of the various 'contexts'. If your context no longer aligns with the user,
      who are you problem-solving/building the solution for?'
      Joining us with Krisztina, Jessica and Dawn will be Manuel from the Book team topologies,
      and together we will explore heuristics to organise teams, and their interaction and design
      bounded context for fast flow, which each serve the same customer."

      "If you could influence one impactful decision today, what would it be? If you could be heard
      and trusted for 10 minutes, what would you say? To whom? More importantly,
      how do you transform recommendations into well-reasoned decisions arrived at collectively?
      In this workshop, we’ll strengthen our ability to craft a strategic argument that gets heard.
      We’ll work together to strengthen a position and the reasons that support it.
      We’ll explore the fundamental skills required and brainstorm follow-up activities."

  - title: "Balancing upfront design versus iterative design"
    date: "Thursday, June 25th. 2020"
    time: "20:00 CEST"

      "We want early feedback to inform foundational or load-bearing decision making before committing to hard/expensive to change design decisions. But we don’t want to start building based on flawed design decisions, the consequences of which are hard/expensive to change when we discover it is faulty. The problem is, how do we balance these two polarities from an either-or to both-and thinking.
      In this session, we will explore contexts and tradeoffs in upfront design versus iterative design. Joining us to share their perspectives and experiences in a never-ending discussion are:
      *Dawn Ahukanna (Design Principal and Front-End Architect)
      *Rebecca Wirfs-Brock (Architecture, Design Heuristics, and Agile Practices)
      *Diana Montalion (Architecting content systems strategies for enterprise)
      *Vladik Khononov (Software Engineer and Cloud Architect) and
      *Trond Hjorteland (IT Architect and aspiring sociotechnical systems designer).
      We will facilitate using a polarity map from Barry Johnson to guide the conversation and find out the patterns and signs to observe to start managing these polarities for yourselves."
