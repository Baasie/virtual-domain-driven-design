      "Those ones who know me they know that I'm a big fan of business modeling and business model innovation. I ran quite a few workshops in this topic, I really like how people come up with great ideas to disrupt a business model.
      In these pandemic times if companies want to survive they really need to think through how they can best align their business to changing needs because of the covid situation. They need to surface, they need to continue delivering value to their customers, but sometimes it is not that straightforward.
      I just have a few examples of recent business model innovation that I would like to share and I would also give some overview of business modeling and innovation in general."
