      "There are a few ways to split and protect your domain code from the intrusion of the technical stacks and other IT fads.

      After having promoted Hexagonal Architecture during all those years, we would like now to show one of its alternative: the Functional Core (combined with Imperative Shell). This short live-coding session will show you what it is and how it articulates with a cool domain.

      Also, and following some recent twitter discussions with Alistair Cockburn, we would like to finish this evening debating what hexagonal architecture is really about...

      Join us in this session with Thomas PIERRAIN - co-organizer of the #DDDFR user group and co-founder of 42skillz, and Bruno BOUCARD - developer, trainer, agile coach and speaker.
