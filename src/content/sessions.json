      "description": "Thanks to Krisztina we will have Matteo Collina as a special guest on our next panel. Matteo is a long time Nodejs contributor and TSC member. Open-source software is a success story, and undoubtedly one, we can learn from. In OSS the clocks tick differently, but it is software built for users, to solve problems - both relatively unknowns factors at the beginning. So what can DDD developers for businesses learn from that experience: how to handle these uncertainties,  how is the Ubiquitous Language developed in the Open source world? How do you do design in OSS? And many more questions!",
