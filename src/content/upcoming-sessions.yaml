  - title: "[Dialogue] Psychologic safety in remote collaboration with Gitte Klitgaard"
    date: "Sep 28, 2020"

      The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced us DDD practitioners to move our collaborative modelling efforts to the remote world. Within collaborative modelling, we want to share all the information we have, all the different perceptions, even if they might look weird, quirky or invalid at the start. Only then can we design and create enriched models to build sustainable and valuable software. The problem here is, people will only share all their information if there is psychological safety, and that is already hard in a physical session, let alone remote.

      In this session, we will have a dialogue with Gitte Klitgaard about the importance of psychological safety in these sessions. Why is it important and what are her heuristics and patterns for it in a remote session.

      Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach with more than a decade of experience working for companies as well as coaching individuals. She lives and loves agile, and hates turf wars, which is why she took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods, when we can use that energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people work better together and feel better about themselves. She is known for speaking her mind in a way that helps people actually listen to what she says; maybe because her main working tools are listening and caring. As an active part of the agile community, Gitte often engages in discussions online and offline, and is part of the organiser team of German Agile Coach Camp as well as a facilitator at other events.
